# f20_epsy5200_assignment11

This repository is for Assignment 11 in the Fall 2020 semester of EPSY 5200 at University of Minnesota taught by Jeff Bye.

The data consists of public domain educational data from Massachussets, as obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ndalziel/massachusetts-public-schools-data

I have removed many columns of data to focus on the more important variables for our analysis.

The main work for this assignment is contained in the .ipynb file (Jupyter Notebook file). However, *before you clone this repo*, let's learn a little more about cloning (and forking!)  Because you're going to **fork** and *then* **clone**.

#### Problem 0

a) Let's watch some videos! I recommend all the videos in this series (for future learning), but we will just focus on two now. Watch the first half of this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NrSWLQsDL4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV&index=3) -- just the part about forking, you can ignore pull requests! Then watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXT1ElMEkW8&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV&index=6 (you don't have to do the terminal git commands, you can use the GitKraken clone strategy we used in class unless you want to do terminal.)

b) Using what you learned in 0a, fork this GitHub repository (remote repo) to your own GitHub account, then **clone your forked repo** (not my repo!) to your hard drive (local repo) using GitKraken (or use the command-line if you want the extra challenge). After finishing EACH problem below, make sure to STAGE and COMMIT with a comment (e.g., "Just finished Part 1! Git is fun!" or whatever). Then PUSH back to GitHub.
